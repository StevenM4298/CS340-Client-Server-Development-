•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

One of the most critical things to accomplish code that is maintainable, readable and adaptable is implementing short, clear and understandable in-line comments. This not only helps you as the developer stay on track, but it is also crucial if you are working on a team. Another element to this is to create sections of code for specific functions. Then, when returning to the code, it is easier to find what you are looking for and make changes without disturbing other elements. However, when bugs or disruption do occur, this method helps you to determine what and where to apply corrections. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My primary technique that I used in this class as well as other similar classes, is thinking about everything as a very iterative process. It helps me to break things down into small segments and understand the functionality of one thing. Then, discover how each of the pieces work together to form a cohesive unit. This is greatly assisted in the planning and research phase by creating maps and diagrams for methods and functions. In addition, understanding the user needs via user stories greatly helps keep you and/or your team focused on the primary objective – satisfying user needs and requirements. 

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists primarily create systems and applications to improve the functions of others. For example, Grazioso Salvare required a database and methods for accessing data. We provided the ability to easily and quickly maneuver through the database, implementing custom filters to sort a large amount of data. By doing this, we will increase productivity and efficiency of the company. This results in happier customers and in the case of Grazioso Salvare, it also results in better care for the animals.
